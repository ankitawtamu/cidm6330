#integer_to_roman
#The following are the steps to write the code.
#define function to convert an integer to roman
#write the list of numbers and their roman equivalent
#define a variable equal to 12(the index no of last number in the list of numbers)
#define a variable that will hold the converted roman numeral and initialize to an empty string
#start a while loop that runs as long as the value of x is not equal to 0
#each time our loop runs we want to look for the largest no in out list of numbers which is less than or equal to x
#if we find a number in the list that is laess than or eual to x we simply wanted to write its roman numeral symbol.
#subtract the number's value from x
#if the if condition is not satisfied then move to the previous index value
#Once the value of x is equal to zero the process of conversion is complete
